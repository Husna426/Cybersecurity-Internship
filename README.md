### [Caesar Cipher Implementation](https://github.com/Husna426/Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Caesar%20Cipher.ipynb)

This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text messages.

#### Features
- Encrypt messages by shifting characters by a user-defined value.
- Decrypt messages by reversing the shift.
- User-friendly interface for inputting messages and shift values.

#### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Provide the shift value.
4. Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.

#### Example
```
Input: "Hello, World!"  
Shift: 3  
Encrypted: "Khoor, Zruog!"
```

### [Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption](https://github.com/Husna426/Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Pixel%20Manipulation%20for%20Image%20Encryption.ipynb)

This project involves creating a tool that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation techniques.

#### Features
- Swap pixel values or apply mathematical operations to encrypt images.
- Reverse the operations to decrypt the image back to its original form.
- Support for common image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

#### How to Use
1. Load an image into the tool.
2. Choose an encryption operation (e.g., pixel swapping, mathematical transformation).
3. Save the encrypted image.
4. Use the decryption option to restore the original image.

### [Password Strength Assessment Tool](https://github.com/Husna426/Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Password%20Complexity%20Checker.ipynb)

This tool assesses the strength of passwords based on predefined criteria and provides feedback to improve password security.

#### Features
- Analyze password strength based on:
  - Length
  - Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
  - Inclusion of numbers and special characters
- Provide feedback to users for creating stronger passwords.

#### Example
```
Input: "Password123!"  
Strength: Strong
Feedback: Great password! Consider using a longer one for added security.
```

### [Keylogger Program] (https://github.com/Husna426/Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/keylogger.ipynb)

This basic keylogger records and logs keystrokes for ethical and educational purposes only.

#### Features
- Capture and log keys pressed on the keyboard.
- Save logs to a local file for analysis.

#### Ethical Considerations
- This project was developed with strict ethical guidelines.
- Ensure appropriate permissions and legal compliance before use.

### [Packet Sniffer Tool](https://github.com/Husna426/Cybersecurity-Internship/blob/main/Network%20Packet%20Analyzer.ipynb)

This project involves developing a packet sniffer tool to capture and analyze network packets.

#### Features
- Capture network traffic in real-time.
- Display relevant information such as:
  - Source and destination IP addresses
  - Payload data
- Designed for educational purposes with ethical usage guidelines.

#### How to Use
1. Run the program with administrator privileges.
2. Monitor network packets and view captured data.
3. Use the output for educational analysis.
